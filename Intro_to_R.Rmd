# Intrdouction
This is an introduction to R. I promise this will be fun. 

## R console
Writing code is fun. So open up R, and you’ll see something like this:
![R console](R_Console.png)

when loading R-Studio it will look like this
![R-Studio](R-Studio.png)

You can do math:
```{r}
1+1
```

Strings are always fun to start with, type a set of letters together within quotes and the console will print it back to you
```{r}
"Hello Mr Tickles"
```
```{r}
"This is a string"
```

Double quotes and single quotes are more or less interchangable, but is better practice to stick with double quotes.

# Variables

Another thing you’ll want to do using R is assign things to a name so that you can use it later. Think of this as being if you were a chipmunk and you buried a nut in the ground to dig up later. You can assign anything in R to a __name__, then use it later (in the current R session of course :)).

Assign the number 5 to the name `mynumber`
```{r}
mynumber <- 5
```

Later you can use `mynumber` , like adding it to another number 
```{r}
mynumber + 1
```

Sweet!
